## About me:
Hi! My name Maria-Theresa and I am 17 years old. I'm a 12th grade student at the Elisabeth von Thadden School. I have always been fascinated by [MINT](https://master-mint.de/): Mathematics, Informatics, Natural Science, and Technology subjects ([more info](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINT-F%C3%A4cher)), therefore I started to do small MINT projects very early on. Now, as I have gained more understanding of these topics, I am more and more interested in Informatics, especially in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). I am also very interested in medicine and biology. 

In my free time, I play sports. I have been playing tennis since I was 7 years old, but since 2015 I am focussing more on golf, which now I play at competitive level. 

  I also love to play piano, which I have been learning for more then 9 years.
